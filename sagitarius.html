          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Sagittarius is an optimist <span class="text-muted">that dreams BIG.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Sagittarius tends to be enthusiastic about life and optimistic about the future. They see no point in dwelling over their misfortunes and instead focus on playing to their strengths.

They’re not afraid to aim high and they’re just crazy enough to believe that they can make all of their dreams come true if they just chase them hard enough.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Sagittarius is candid<span class="text-muted">  and honest.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">The Sagittarius is one of the most direct and straight forward personalities in all of the zodiac. Some may find them a bit too blunt at times but friends often find their honesty to be a breathe of fresh air.

They will tell it to you straight and wont try to sugar coat every little thing making them a great person to go to when you want nothing but the straight up truth.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading"> Sagittarius is independent <span class="text-muted">and hates being told how to live.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">There's few things that a Sagittarius hates more than pointless rules being enforced upon them by people that have no right to do so.

If you try to control their every move or interrogate them about every little thing then they'll distance themselves FAST.</p>
