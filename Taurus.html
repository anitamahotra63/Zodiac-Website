          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Taurus is often called upon for advice <span class="text-muted">because they are FULL of common sense.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">The Taurus is well known for their practical mind and it's for this reason that they often find themselves being called upon by friends and loved ones who are in need of a second opinion or just some damn good advice.

When problems arise you can count on Taurus to give you a healthy dose of common sense.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Taurus they can be notoriously <span class="text-muted">impatient at times.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">One of the more negative traits of the Taurus would definitely have to be their low tolerance levels it comes to delays, cues or anything that's slow moving and mind numbingly boring.

Taurus is a go getter and when things get in their way and prevent them from moving forward it can frustrate them to no end.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading"> Taurus has a stubborn side <span class="text-muted">that doesn't back down easily</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Yes the rumors are true. Taurus can be a stubborn creature at times especially when they truly believe that they are in the right.

They are strong minded individuals with firm convictions and when they're convinced of something it can take a lot for them to change their mind.</p>
