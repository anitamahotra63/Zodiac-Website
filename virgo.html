          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Virgo doesn't just talk about it...<span class="text-muted">they do it.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Virgos aren't 'all talk no action' types. When they decide that they are going to do something you better believe that they are going to work at it until they make it happen.

They are goal setters with the determination and self discipline to persevere when things get tough allowing them to achieve just about anything that they put their mind to.</p>

          <p class="lead">Virgos have clever minds and a keen attention to detail that allows them find solutions to problems that others simply miss.

They are able to break down seemingly impossible problems into small and workable parts and then come up with a solution that actually works.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Virgo stays organized and <span class="text-muted">can't stand clutter.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Virgos are systematic about things and they like to organize their lives to ensure that everything runs as smooth as possible.

They tend to be 'clean freaks' who find it hard to focus and get things done when they're surrounded by mess and clutter.</p>
