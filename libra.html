          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Libra will forgive… <span class="text-muted">but they wont forget.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">The Libra doesn’t have time to waste on holding unnecessary grudges and when someone screws up they are usually forgiving enough to give them a second chance.

However they’re also smart enough to learn from their mistakes and they tend to remember everything so that they don’t make the same error of judgement twice.</p>

          <p class="lead">The Libra is a strong advocate of truth and justice and they will go out of their way to make sure that everybody gets fair treatment.

They're not afraid to stand up for those that who are treated poorly and they're also quick to admit to their own mistakes rather than trying to 'pass the blame' onto someone else.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Libra doesn't believe anything <span class="text-muted">without seeing it with their own eyes first.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">The Libra tends to be extremely skeptical by nature choosing to analyze things objectively and come to their own conclusions... rather than rely on the gossip of others.

They like to see something with their own eyes before they believe it to be true.</p>
