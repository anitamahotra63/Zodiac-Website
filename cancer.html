          <p class="lead">Cancers are generally pretty easy going in their approach to life but don't mistake that for thinking that they will just allow people to walk all over them.

When provoked their claws will come out and they'll be sure to put you in your place in the way that only a Cancer can.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Cancer is always there <span class="text-muted">for their friends, period.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">There are very few things that Cancer values more than their friendships and they will do just about anything to help out a close friend.

They are great listeners and when someone that they care about hits a rough patch they are often willing to drop everything to lend their support.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading"> Cancer craves deeper and <span class="text-muted">more meaningful relationships.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Cancers often find themself less interested in fleeting romances but instead craving the intimacy and closeness that only comes form a longer term commitment.

They can take their time to find the right person but once they do they tend to form an extremely deep bond with that person and give the relationship everything they've got.</p>
