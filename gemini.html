          <p class="lead">The mind of the Gemini is constantly racing and contemplating all sorts of thoughts, ideas and questions.

          <p class="lead">Geminis tend to be extremely independent and self reliant and they like to forge their own path in life rather than live in someone else's shadow.

They need the freedom to be able to live life on their own terms and if you are trying to control them or 'box them in' then they will be quick to distance themself from you.</p>
